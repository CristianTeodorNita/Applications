'''
Write a program in which:
-  Write a method in which we generate first m numbers divisible by n. In this case, we want to get in a list and print
    the first 500 numbers divisible by 7.

-  save all of those numbers in a file, one number per each row. The file will be called â€žfile_numbers.txt"
In the next steps, we're interested in using as little memory as possible.

-  create a generator which does exactly the same thing as above: generate the first 500 numbers divisible by 7
    (the number of numbers generated is parametrizable) and save it to a file called "file_numbers_new.txt"

-  read the numbers from file ("file_numbers_new.txt") and compute their average without keeping the entire list in memory.
